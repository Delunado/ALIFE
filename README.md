### What's "ALIFE" about?
ALIFE means "Artificial Life". It's an experiment about Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms using Unity.

## Actual Version (V 0.1)
First, a random map is generated. A bunch of creatures are created, ready to explore the world. This creatures can move around the map, searching for food and just exploring.

The creatures can be hungry, so they need to find food. They get smaller and smaller if they don't eat. If their hunger is high enough, the creatures die.

The creatures have different attributes. Some are faster in their movement, others can stay longer without eating, etc.


## For next version...
These are a list of things to include in the next version:

- Include **vision** on creatures. The creatures can sense if there is food near then, depending on their vision range.
- Include **A*** algorithm for food searching. When a creature detect the food, it will go straight to it. 
- **Better world generation algorithm**. Now there are closed zones, where creatures can't go to. It the new gen algorithm, there won't be closed zones. 


## Try It

#### Controls:
- **Space**: Create a new world.
